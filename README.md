# Computer-Vision
Hello!
My name is Nikhil Patolia and this repo is a collection of the work that me and my partner, Alec Hardy, completed 
for our Computer Vision class.  There are 5 projects with "Clock A2D" being our final project where we were able
to create a project of our own and present it to the class.  Each project folder has a Report PDF file that explains
all of our work that we did for each proejct and the final project has an additionaly set of presentation slides.
